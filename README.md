# PHP-Advanced Project

This project demonstrates fundamental PHP concepts including date/time handling, file operations, cookies, sessions, functions, arrays, and JSON processing.

## Features Covered

## 1. Date and Time

* Display current date and time using PHP's `date()` function.
* Format date/time in various styles.

## 2. Require and Include

* Use `require` and `include` statements to modularize code.
* Include external PHP files for better organization.

## 3. File Operations

* Open files for reading and writing using `fopen()`.
* Read file contents with `fread()` or `file_get_contents()`.
* Write data to files using `fwrite()`.
* Close files with `fclose()`.

## 4. Cookies

* Delete cookies by setting expiration in the past.

## 5. Sessions

* Start sessions using `session_start()`.
* Store and retrieve session variables.
* Destroy sessions to log users out.

## 6. Functions

* Define reusable functions with parameters and return values.
* Use functions to organize and simplify code.

## 7. Arrays

* Create indexed and associative arrays.
* Manipulate arrays (add, remove, loop through).
* Use array functions like `count()`, `array_push()`, etc.

## 8. JSON

* Encode PHP arrays/objects to JSON with `json_encode()`.
* Decode JSON strings to PHP variables with `json_decode()`.
